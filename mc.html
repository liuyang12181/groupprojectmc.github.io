<br>
<h3>At McDonald’s, we take great care to ensure that what we serve every day is safe, quality food. <br>
    That means we use 100% real beef patties seasoned with just a pinch of salt and pepper. <br>It means our Egg McMuffin® is made with a freshly cracked egg.<br> And, our Filet-O-Fish® sandwich is made with 100% whitefish sourced from sustainably managed fisheries. <br>It means our Chicken McNuggets® are made with white meat chicken. <br>Simply put, it means real, quality ingredients and always evolving what matters to you.<h3>

  <p class="ti">Antibiotics Policies</p><br>
  <p class="talk">We believe in the responsible use of antibiotics important to human medicine* to help preserve their effectiveness for human and animal health in the future. <br>In August of 2016, we accomplished our goal to only source chickens in the U.S. not treated with antibiotics important to human medicine.** Building on this progress, in 2017 we set out to eliminate the highest priority antibiotics across our global chicken supply chain.
    <br>  <br>
We didn’t stop there. In December 2018, McDonald’s announced a policy to reduce the overall use of antibiotics important to human health, in our beef supply chain. Our policy covers for our top 10 beef sourcing markets around the world, including the U.S., representing more than 85% of our global beef supply.
<br>  <br>

 <p class="talk">Burgers are an integral part of our menu, but that’s just one of the reasons we’re on a journey to advance more sustainable beef production. <br>We’re striving to improve environmental practices in how beef is produced, make a positive difference in the lives of farmers, and to drive improvements in animal health and welfare. <br>By joining forces with our partners, our beef sustainability goal is to influence industry-wide changes on a global scale.</p>

 <p class="talk">We’re on a food journey, and our menu shows it. <br>We’ve evolved everything from how we cook our beef patties, to the ingredients we use in new and old favorites. <br>We use real butter for our breakfast items and a freshly cracked egg in our Egg McMuffin®. <br>In 2018, we announced that all of our seven classic burgers* have no artificial preservatives, no artificial flavors and no added colors from artificial sources.<br> (Our pickle contains an artificial preservative, so skip it if you like.)</p>

In 2017, 54% of our coffee globally was sourced sustainably through Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, Fair Trade International and Fair TradeUSA certifications, as well as programs approved by the McCafé Sustainability Improvement Platform, a framework to guide our entire coffee supply chain.<br> Not only are we committed to protecting soil and water, but McDonald’s and its partners empower local farmers with training in sustainable agriculture techniques.<br> Already 100% of the espresso beans used in the McCafé beverages restaurants are sustainably sourced and Rainforest Alliance Certified™.<br><br>
